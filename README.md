## Use any object as a Vue.js component

##### Use any object as component
anyVue is a Vue component that allows you to effortlessly transform any JavaScript class into a reusable Vue component. By taking in a construct prop that defines the class, anyVue creates an instance of the class and binds it to the parent component using the v-model directive.

##### Reactive object properties 
anyVue automatically assigns any attributes assigned to the component to corresponding properties of the created instance. And the best part is that the properties are reactive, making it easy to pass data to the underlying JavaScript class and ensuring seamless updates throughout your Vue application.

##### Trees and graphs possible
In addition, the library is capable of handling intricate data structures like trees. This makes it effortless to integrate such complex data structures into your Vue application, thereby providing developers with a valuable tool in the form of AnyVue.

##### Extend your application easily and declarative
The resulting Vue component is both reusable and reactive, making it easy to incorporate existing JavaScript classes into your Vue application. With anyVue, you can create powerful and customizable components without having to write any additional boilerplate code.
